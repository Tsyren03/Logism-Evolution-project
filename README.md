My project, "Simple Ice Hockey," serves as an educational tool for learning how LED matrices work within Logisim Evolution. It involves simulating a basic ice hockey game where players interact with a grid of LEDs representing the hockey rink. The project focuses on understanding how to control individual LEDs in the matrix to create moving objects like a puck or player indicators. Additionally, the project introduces fundamental concepts of logic gates, multiplexers, and decoders, which are essential for managing the LED matrix display in a digital circuit environment.
